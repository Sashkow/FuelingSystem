FuelingSystem
=============

C++ Project on modelling cenrtalized system of fueling stations.

Vehicle objects are constructed according to Factory design pattern. 

Simulation class generates random poisson distributed Vehicle vector at each timestep.

Simulation also updates Station, FuelingPoint, Vehicle objects states at each timestep.

Station class works as client. System class works as server.
